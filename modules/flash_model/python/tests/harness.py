"""A software stand-in for the VHDL verification component.

Every protocol test drives the model through this, and it deliberately
*follows the directives* instead of assuming the phase structure of the
command it is issuing. If the model says "receive, 2 lanes, 8 dummy
cycles", the harness receives one byte and records the lane and dummy
counts; it never decides for itself that a 0x3B has an address phase. A
harness that assumed the phases would still pass when the model returned
nonsense directives, which is the only thing the VC actually consumes.
