"""Protocol mode: SPI vs QPI, 3- vs 4-byte addressing, and continuous read.

These three pieces of state change how the *next* transaction is decoded,
which is why they live in one small object instead of being scattered
through the state machine. Two of them are notorious sources of silent
misbehaviour in flash models:

* 4-byte addressing. `EN4B`/`EX4B` (and some parts' status bit) switch the
  length of the address phase for every "current addressing mode" opcode.
  Getting this wrong shifts every subsequent address by a byte and still
  looks like plausible data.

* Continuous read / XIP. After a `0xEB`-class command the host clocks a
  mode byte. If `M5:M4 == 0b10`, the NEXT transaction has **no opcode at
  all** -- CS falls and the device is already in its address phase. A model
  that ignores the mode byte will decode the first address byte as an
  opcode, which is usually an unsupported opcode, which is silently
  ignored: the failure surfaces as "the DUT's XIP reads return 0xFF", a
  long way from the cause.

Anything other than `0b10` in `M5:M4` leaves (or exits) continuous read,
which is exactly how a host exits XIP without a dedicated command.
