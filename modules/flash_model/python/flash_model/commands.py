"""The JEDEC opcode table, as data.

Every property the state machine needs in order to execute an opcode --
how many address bytes, how many dummy cycles, how wide each phase is,
which direction the data flows, whether WEL must be set, whether the
command is legal while the device is busy -- is a field of one immutable
`Command` record. `device.py` walks those fields; it never asks "which
opcode is this".

Why: a chain of `if opcode == 0x..` is where flash models go to die. The
dual/quad read family alone is eight near-identical commands differing
only in lane widths and dummy cycles, and the 4-byte-address family
duplicates half the table again. Expressed as data, adding `0x3C` or
`0x77` is one row; expressed as control flow it is another branch to get
subtly wrong. It also means the table itself can be asserted against the
SFDP bytes the model reports, so the two cannot disagree.

Baseline is generic JEDEC with BOTH 3- and 4-byte addressing:
`AddrLen.CURRENT` follows `mode.addr_bytes`, while `0x13`/`0x0C`/`0x12`/
`0xDC` pin 4 bytes and `0x5A` (RDSFDP) pins 3 regardless of mode, per
JESD216.
