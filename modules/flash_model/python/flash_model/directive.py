"""The packed directive: the single 32-bit integer every `cs_assert` /
`xfer` call hands back to the VHDL verification component.

Authoritative layout: `doc/flash_model_ffi_contract.md`. The VC has the
same field table hand-written in `sim/flash_model_pkg.vhd`, so the two
sides can only agree by both matching that document -- `LAYOUT_VERSION`
is the run-time guard that they still do.

Why one packed integer rather than several calls: VUnit's Python bridge
returns exactly one value per call, and a directive is needed on the
critical path of every single byte. Packing six fields into one integer
turns "what do I do with the next byte" into one FFI round trip instead
of six.

Every field describes the SAME, next action -- one tense throughout.
`pre_dummy_cycles` is a prefix on that action, never a phase of its own,
which is what lets `0x6B` (address x1 -> 8 dummy -> data x4) be a single
directive and also covers the commands where dummy cycles precede a
*receive*.

The whole layout is capped at 30 bits because VHDL's `integer` is signed
32-bit: a packed value at or above 2**31 is simply not representable on the
other side of the bridge.
